# MQTT Notification Server
This is a NodeJS Server that listen to a MQTT ADAFRUIT realtime connection and fires a push notification when limites are exceded , also this project integrates CI/CD with Github Actions, AWS EC2, Docker and Docker Compose. Rigth now this project is not as flexible as I wanned to be but in the future I will be adding more interesting features.

Currently all `feeds` are harcoded.
